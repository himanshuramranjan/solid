> let say I dont make it singleton then multiple instances of OrderProcessor and TradeMatching can be created,
wont it make my process faster to execute then why we will define a singleton class at all at place ?

Why NOT having Singleton for something like OrderProcessor or TradeMatchingEngine might seem faster?
Multiple instances can handle different orders in parallel without waiting on a single shared object.

This can improve throughput and reduce contention in highly concurrent systems.

You might think: “More instances = more threads processing independently = faster.”

BUT... here’s why Singleton or shared instance often wins for these specific classes:
1. Shared mutable state and data integrity
These classes interact with shared resources like the OrderBook, portfolios, and trades.

If multiple OrderProcessor instances act independently, they might conflict when accessing/modifying shared data (e.g., order book updates, portfolios).

Without proper synchronization, it can cause race conditions, inconsistent state, lost updates.

2. Complex synchronization requirements
You’d need complex locking or concurrent data structures everywhere to keep data consistent.

That can actually degrade performance and increase bugs.

Using a single instance centralizes synchronization and coordination, which can be easier to reason about.

3. Maintaining correctness over raw speed
In finance or stock broker apps, correctness and consistency are critical — e.g., you can’t sell stocks you don’t have or buy beyond your balance.

So often, it’s more important that trades are processed correctly and atomically rather than just as fast as possible.

How to get both correctness and concurrency?
Use Singleton with careful synchronization on shared state, e.g., synchronized methods or locks in OrderProcessor.

Or better, make the shared mutable state thread-safe (concurrent collections, atomic variables).

You can still process multiple orders in parallel if those orders don’t conflict (e.g., different stocks or different investors).

You can shard or partition your data structures (order books per stock) to reduce contention.

Or adopt an event-driven architecture where orders are queued and processed by a thread pool, but the core matching engine remains a single logical component ensuring consistency.

TL;DR
Scenario	Multiple Instances	Singleton Instance
Lots of independent orders	May run faster, but risk data conflicts	Serializes or synchronizes shared access
Shared state mutation	Hard to maintain consistency	Easier to keep consistent and atomic
Correctness critical	Risk of bugs, inconsistent portfolio balances	Safer, predictable trade processing
Performance optimization	Use concurrency carefully with partitioning/sharding	Simplifies synchronization but can be bottleneck

In your app’s context:
OrderProcessor singleton helps ensure all orders are processed consistently, even if it serializes some parts.

You can still process many orders concurrently if you shard order books or use concurrent queues internally.

Singleton doesn’t prevent concurrency; it just controls the shared logic and coordination point.

Final thought
Singleton does not mean your whole system is single-threaded or slow. It means the core logic instance is single, and you design concurrency around it safely.
