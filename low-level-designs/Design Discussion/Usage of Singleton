Singleton Design Pattern ‚Äì When to Use / Not Use

‚úÖ When to Use Singleton
1. Global Access Required
    * The instance must be accessible from anywhere in the application.
    * Example: Logging service (Logger), configuration manager.
2. Stateless or Immutable Behavior
    * Singleton is safe when the object does not hold mutable state that changes per user/session.
    * Example: NotificationService that only sends messages.
3. Single Point of Coordination
    * When one object should manage a global resource or orchestrate actions consistently.
    * Example: MeetingService (orchestrator for scheduling/canceling meetings).
4. Resource Intensive Objects
    * If instantiating an object is costly, Singleton avoids repeated construction.
    * Example: Database connection pool, thread pool manager.
5. Controlling Shared Resources
    * Singleton ensures that only one instance interacts with a critical shared resource.
    * Example: File manager, system registry handler.
6. Lazy Initialization
    * When you want to create the instance only when it is first needed.
    * Example: Lazy-loaded caches or deferred loggers.

‚ùå When NOT to Use Singleton
1. Stateful Per User/Request
    * If the class holds state specific to a user, session, or request, Singleton causes shared state issues.
    * Example: ShoppingCart, UserSession, TransactionContext.
2. Scalability / Distributed Systems
    * Singleton is limited to one JVM. In a multi-node or microservices setup, you can‚Äôt enforce a true singleton across nodes.
    * Example: Stateless services like MeetingService in a distributed system.
3. Testability / Mocking Challenges
    * Singletons introduce hidden global dependencies, making unit testing and mocking difficult.
    * Example: Complex business services with external dependencies.
4. Multiple Configurations Needed
    * If you may need multiple instances with different configurations, Singleton is restrictive.
    * Example: EmailService with different SMTP configs per tenant.
5. Overuse Can Lead to Anti-pattern
    * Using Singleton everywhere leads to tight coupling, global state, and hidden dependencies.
    * Example: Making all services Singletons in a monolithic app is not good practice.
6. Concurrency Concerns for Stateful Singletons
    * If Singleton holds mutable state, you need proper synchronization, otherwise it can cause thread-safety issues.
    * Example: Singleton cache or queue manager with shared mutable data.

üí° Practical Examples

| Class / Service                | Singleton? | Reason                                                                  |
| ------------------------------ | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------  |
| Logger                         | ‚úÖ Yes      | Global, stateless, cheap access everywhere                             |
| NotificationService            | ‚úÖ Yes      | Centralized orchestration, stateless                                   |
| MeetingService (stateless)     | ‚úÖ Optional | Central orchestration; safe as singleton, can refactor later if needed |
| Calendar                       | ‚ùå No       | Holds user-specific meetings (stateful)                                |
| UserService                    | ‚ùå No       | Manages per-user state                                                 |
| ShoppingCart                   | ‚ùå No       | Session-specific, stateful                                             |
| ConfigurationManager           | ‚úÖ Yes      | Global config, read-only or immutable                                  |
| Database Connection Pool       | ‚úÖ Yes      | Single resource manager for DB connections                             |
| CacheManager (per application) | ‚úÖ Yes      | Shared cache, centralized access                                       |
| PaymentTransactionManager      | ‚ùå No       | Stateful per transaction/session                                       |
